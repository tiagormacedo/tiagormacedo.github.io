                <h3> Intro </h3>

                <p>
                    The main goal of the technical editorial process is to fit all the articles that are published by Communications in Mathematics into the same standards.  To do that the technical editors will edit the source files sent by the authors and modify the parts that do not adhere to the format of the journal.  More details about this process are contained in the steps below.
                </p>
            </section>


            <section class="step" id="step1">
                <h3> Step 1: review the manuscript </h3>
                
                <p>
                    First, process the tex file sent by the authors using the following form:
                </p>

                <div style="text-align: center">
                    <form action="https://tmacedo.pythonanywhere.com/cim/" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" target="form-target">
                        <label for="infile"> Upload tex: </label>
                        <input type="file" name="infile" id="infile" required />
                        <button type="submit" class="button" id="display-links">
                            process
                        </button>
                        <iframe name="form-target" class="invisible"></iframe>
                    </form>

                    
                    <p>
                        <a id="raw_outfile" class="invisible" target="_blank">raw file</a>
                        <span> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>
                        <a id="edited_outfile" class="invisible" target="_blank">edited file</a>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Alternatively, you can use <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KvmhIyxARafJm8qCPoxIfS2JgVLdP-ti">this Python notebook</a> to process the tex file sent by the authors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, within two days, double-check the following: 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spell and grammar.  My suggestion is that you use a large language model (such as ChatGPT, Deepseek, ...) to review the text. Here is a suggested prompt that you can use: "Assume you are a copy editor. I would like you to review the punctuation and spelling of the attached scientific article.  Please note that this is a scientific article in the field of Mathematics and is written in English.  Please, return to me all the instances in the text of this article where there is a typographical or punctuation error."
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If there are any sentences starting with a mathematical formula.  My suggestion is that
                        you search for <span class="latex">. $</span> in the tex file and rephrase those sentences.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If there are any mathematical formulas that break between two lines.  My suggestion is that
                        you: either use a display <span class="latex">\[ ... \]</span>, or reorder, or rephrase the sentence.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Avoid inline formulas longer than half of a line; use math display
                        <span class="latex">\[ ... \]</span> instead. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Always use the enumerate and itemize environments for lists.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Instead of numbering equations or citing a reference by hand (using 
                        parenthesis or brackets), use <span class="latex">\cite</span>, <span class="latex">\ref</span> and <span class="latex">\eqref</span>.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Clear all the errors, warnings, overfull and underfull boxes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Step 2: send pdf to the authors </h3>

                <p> 
                    As soon as you are done reviewing the authors' manuscript send it back to
                    the authors, asking if there are any further changes that they would like
                    you to make.

                <p>
                    Here is a template email that you can use:

                <h3> Step 3: make final edits </h3>

                <p>
                    When the authors and you agree with all the edition of their article, it is
                    time to do the final editing of their manuscript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, add the following lines right before <span class="latex">\begin{document}</span>:
                </p>

                <blocktex>
                    \VOLUME{&lt;volume number&gt;}<br />
                    \YEAR{&lt;volume year&gt;}<br />
                    \ISSUE{&lt;issue number&gt;}<br />
                    \NUMBER{&lt; ask head technical editor &gt;}<br />
                    \DOI{https://doi.org/10.46298/cm.&lt;id of the paper&gt;}
                </blocktex>

                <img src="images/cim-paper_data.png" />

                <p>
                    Then, add the following line right before <span class="latex">\end{document}</span>:
                </p>

                <blocktex>
                    \EditInfo{&lt;received date&gt;}{&lt;acceptance date&gt;}{&lt;handling editor&gt;}

                <p>
                    Lastly, replace <span class="latex">\bibliography{cimart}</span> in the tex file by the contents of the .bbl file that is created during compilation.  (This is important in order to avoid problems when ArXiv compiles the tex file.)
